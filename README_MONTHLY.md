# Rainfall-Runoff Statistical Analysis - MONTHLY VERSION

Statistical analysis framework using **monthly aggregated data** to investigate the relationship between precipitation and runoff across 1089 US basins.

## Why Monthly Analysis?

**Advantages over daily analysis:**
1. **Integrates temporal lag** - Runoff response naturally captured within monthly window
2. **Accounts for storage effects** - Soil moisture memory implicitly included
3. **Reduces noise** - Better signal-to-noise ratio
4. **Physically meaningful** - Monthly water balance (input vs output)
5. **Standard practice** - Common in hydrology and climate studies

**Expected improvements:**
- Correlation strength: ~3-5x stronger (from ρ=0.12 to ρ=0.4-0.5)
- Clearer spatial patterns
- Better interpretability

## Files

- `preprocess_monthly.py` - Convert daily to monthly data
- `rainfall_runoff_analysis_monthly.py` - Main monthly analysis script
- `submit_analysis_monthly.sh` - SLURM batch submission script
- `merge_results_monthly.py` - Combines individual basin results
- `README_MONTHLY.md` - This file

## Workflow

### Step 0: Preprocess Daily to Monthly Data

```bash
python preprocess_monthly.py
```

This will:
- Read daily data from `/icebox/data/shares/mh2/mosavat/Lumped/data/processed/temporal_test/timeseries/`
- Aggregate to monthly (SUM for both precipitation and runoff)
- Save to `/icebox/data/shares/mh2/mosavat/Lumped/data/processed/temporal_test/timeseries_monthly/`
- Convert ~3650 daily points → ~120 monthly points per basin

**Aggregation method:**
- Precipitation: Monthly SUM (total rainfall in month)
- Runoff: Monthly SUM (total runoff in month)

### Step 1: Submit SLURM Job Array

```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x submit_analysis_monthly.sh

# Submit jobs
sbatch submit_analysis_monthly.sh
```

This launches 1089 parallel jobs analyzing monthly data.

### Step 2: Monitor Progress

```bash
# Check job status
squeue -u $USER

# Count completed jobs
ls /icebox/data/shares/mh2/mosavat/Lumped/results/temp_monthly/basin_*.csv | wc -l

# View a log
tail -f log_monthly/basin_0001.out
```

### Step 3: Merge Results

```bash
python merge_results_monthly.py
```

Output saved to: `/icebox/data/shares/mh2/mosavat/Environmental_Data_Analysis/results/all_basins_results_monthly.csv`

The merge script also provides comparison with daily results!

## Output Format

Same structure as daily results, with additional column:
- `n_months` - Number of monthly data points used

## Key Differences from Daily Analysis

| Aspect | Daily | Monthly |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Data points per basin | 3650 | ~120 |
| Temporal resolution | 1 day | 1 month |
| Lag handling | None (same-day) | Implicit (within-month) |
| Expected correlation | Weak (ρ~0.12) | Moderate-Strong (ρ~0.4-0.5) |
| Physical meaning | Instantaneous | Water balance |
| Noise level | High | Low |

## Expected Results

Based on hydrological theory:

**Correlation Strength:**
- Daily: Mean ρ = 0.12 (weak)
- Monthly: Mean ρ = 0.4-0.5 (moderate to strong)
- **3-5x improvement expected**

**Significance:**
- Both should show >95% significant
- Monthly will have stronger p-values

**Tail Dependence:**
- Upper tail (chi_U) likely stronger in monthly
- Lower tail (chi_L) may become non-zero

**Copula Distribution:**
- May see shift toward Gumbel (upper tail dependence)
- Less Clayton dominance
- More symmetric patterns

## Scientific Justification

Monthly aggregation is justified because:

1. **Lag integration**: Most basins have response times < 1 month
2. **Storage buffering**: Monthly scale captures soil moisture dynamics
3. **Water balance principle**: Monthly P and Q represent basin-scale water accounting
4. **Literature support**: Standard approach in climate-hydrology studies
5. **Practical relevance**: Water resources planning often uses monthly timescales

## Troubleshooting

### Preprocessing Errors
If preprocessing fails:
```bash
# Check if daily data exists
ls /icebox/data/shares/mh2/mosavat/Lumped/data/processed/temporal_test/timeseries/ | head

# Check basin list
head /icebox/data/shares/mh2/mosavat/Lumped/temporal_test_basins.txt
```

### Analysis Errors
Same troubleshooting as daily analysis - check logs in `log_monthly/`

## Comparison Script

After both analyses complete, compare results:

```python
import pandas as pd

daily = pd.read_csv('results/all_basins_results.csv')
monthly = pd.read_csv('results/all_basins_results_monthly.csv')

print(f"Daily mean correlation: {daily['spearman_rho'].mean():.3f}")
print(f"Monthly mean correlation: {monthly['spearman_rho'].mean():.3f}")
print(f"Improvement: {monthly['spearman_rho'].mean() / daily['spearman_rho'].mean():.2f}x")
```

## For Your Presentation

**Key points to emphasize:**

1. "We conducted analyses at both daily and monthly timescales"
2. "Monthly aggregation accounts for temporal lag and storage effects"
3. "This is a standard approach in hydrology for water balance studies"
4. "Monthly analysis shows X-fold stronger correlations, confirming that lag was masking the true relationship"
5. "Both analyses show >95% significant correlations, but monthly reveals the strength of the relationship"

## Next Steps

After monthly analysis:
1. Compare daily vs monthly results
2. Create maps for monthly results (similar to daily)
3. Discuss why monthly improves correlation in presentation
4. Consider seasonal analysis (wet vs dry months)

## Notes

- Sample size reduced from 3650 to ~120, but signal is much stronger
- Statistical power remains adequate (n=120 is sufficient)
- Monthly is more interpretable for water resources applications
- Both analyses are valid - they answer slightly different questions

**Remember:** This supplements (not replaces) your daily analysis. Both are valuable!
